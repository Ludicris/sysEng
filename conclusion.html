                  <h1><b>User-Experience</b></h1>
                  <p class="lead">
                    One of the primary requirements from our clients was to
                    ensure that the app development was centered around the
                    needs of our target user-base, which largely consists of
                    people with impairments. With this in mind, we consistently
                    evaluated our project from their perspective throughout the
                    development process.
                    <br /><br />
                    To make the app more accessible to visually impaired
                    individuals, we incorporated large text and icons. We also
                    added voice callouts to serve as a virtual assistant and to
                    make the workout process more user-friendly. Additionally,
                    we enabled voice control to allow users to ask for sensor
                    information and workout details while exercising.
                    <br /><br />
                    In order to promote user safety, we implemented callouts
                    that notify users when their heart rate falls outside of the
                    intended range. These callouts also provide helpful warnings
                    such as 'Slow down' or 'Speed up' to encourage users to
                    modify their workout accordingly.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog text">
                  <h1><b>Functionality</b></h1>
                  <p class="lead">
                    Another target for the project was to ensure optimal
                    functionality. The minimum set by our client was to ensure
                    that a user could go through one whole iteration of the app
                    in which they will be able to:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><p class="lead">Connect sensors</p></li>
                    <li><p class="lead">Start a workout</p></li>
                    <li>
                      <p class="lead">See their heart rate information</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p class="lead">Finish a workout</p></li>
                    <li><p class="lead">See their health data</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="lead">
                    We were able to fulfill all of the above whilst also adding
                    in extra functionality to ensure a good user-experience thus
                    fulfilling all the requirements from our client
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="help text">
                  <h1><b>Stability-Efficiency</b></h1>
                  <p class="lead">
                    There are a few areas of concern regarding our app that
                    require attention. Firstly, we have identified an issue
                    related to saving workouts that needs to be resolved. When
                    saving more than two workouts, the app crashes due to a
                    threshold being exceeded in the number of graphs stored in
                    the app. We have traced this issue to the Syncfusion plugin
                    we were using, and it appears to be a limitation of the
                    trial version of the plugin. We acknowledge that this
                    instability in graph storage is problematic and will require
                    a robust solution.
                    <br /><br />
                    Another concern we have is related to the use of third-party
                    services to implement some of the app's features. For
                    instance, we require Microsoft Azure and Syncfusion for
                    functionalities like voice control and graph rendering,
                    respectively. While these services enhance the app's
                    functionality, they are subscription-based, and the costs
                    may become unmanageable for our clients down the line. We
                    need to consider alternative options to address this
                    concern.
                    <br /><br />
                    Additionally, we use the Plugin.BLE, a community-developed
                    plugin, to enable BLE connections as .NET MAUI currently
                    lacks in-built Bluetooth support. Although this plugin has
                    proven useful, it is also more prone to bugs than other
                    plugins. During the development cycle, we encountered
                    several issues that required resolution. We need to address
                    these concerns to ensure the app's reliability and
                    stability.

                    We developed the app as per our clients' request, making it
                    exclusively compatible with Android devices. Although we
                    utilized a cross-platform framework, the app's features
                    require platform-specific code, such as Bluetooth, that
                    would make core features unusable and lead to errors if run
                    on other platforms.
                    <br /><br />
                    Furthermore, the app can be executed locally on an Android
                    Emulator, but we must highlight that the sensor integration
                    will be unusable as Bluetooth remains unavailable on
                    emulators at this time of writing. We are aware that this
                    may limit the app's accessibility for some users and are
                    open to exploring alternatives that can provide a more
                    inclusive experience across different platforms in the
                    future.

                    Our development team primarily utilized the

                    separation of concerns, resulting in a well-modularized
                    project. This approach ensures that each component of the
                    app is independent of others, making it much easier for

                    Our development team was effectively managed, with a focus
                    on open communication and collaboration with our clients.
                    From the project's outset, we organized frequent meetings,
                    initially on a weekly basis, which all team members attended
                    regularly. As the project advanced, we recognized the need
                    to adjust meeting frequency to bi-weekly intervals to ensure
                    effective time management.
                    <br /><br />
                    We utilized Gantt charts and project timelines to
                    effectively allocate tasks and ensure that we met all
                    project deadlines. Additionally, our team culture emphasized
                    mutual support and collaboration, which allowed us to offer
                    assistance to any team member struggling with their assigned
                    tasks. This approach facilitated a smooth and efficient
                    workflow throughout the development cycle.

            In the future, we would like to add more accessibility features to
            the app to allow for a more streamlined experience for our users. A
            key feature would be to allow for the enabling of callouts with
            regards to the graphs, meaning the user would be able to tap on a
            specific area of the graph and the app would callout that specific
            data point. We would also like to generalise this feature so that
            once a workout finishes the voice assistant gives an overall review
            on the experience and offer personalised feedback.
            <br /><br />
            We would also like to expand the app to other platforms such as iOS
            and Windows considering this would increase the userbase by several
            folds.
            <br /><br />
            We would also like to enable integration with health apps such as
            Apple’s Healthkit as this would provide the app with more
            personalised information regarding the user which would greatly
            imporve the feedback the app would be able to give

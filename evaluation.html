            Users will undoubtedly use this app every day, in order to make it
            error free, we had to thoroughly test it, both by using the app
            every day ourselves, as well as testing it through series of unit
            and integration tests. In our use case, we tried making the testing
            process as intuitive for the developers, as the app is for the
            users. From a high-level perspective we realised that there are to
            main aspects of the app, which are not only crucial for its
            functioning, but represent the foundation for any future
            modifications to the app. We know there are two core components,
            since everything a person does in the app is either directly or
            indirectly connected to creating, saving, editing, as well as
            recording workouts or reviewing the insights about past exercises.
            Therefore we decided to focus our testing on those two key points.

                  In the real-world, Project-VeloCity will be used by a range of
                  people in a variety of circumstances and so in the process we
                  must consider human behaviour and how one would/could interact
                  with the app. Consequently, every aspect of the app must be
                  thoroughly tested to ensure it is capable (or not) in dealing
                  with a variety of user behaviour.

                  The aim of Project-Velocity is to aid users during their
                  workout and provide a user-friendly assistant to ease the
                  workout process and so the app’s functionality should be
                  tested against this precedent thus meeting all the users need
                </p>

          <h3>Test Methodology</h3>
          <div class="l-container">
            <p class="lead">
              We used xUnit as our testing tool, mainly testing key functioning
              components for the app with unit tests. Additionally, in order to
              simulate interactions between multiple components of the app,
              apart from testing individual parts, we used integration testing
              approach where we tested the important functionalities such as
              saving and extracting data about both saved workouts and insights,
              which represent the core use case of our app. In the following
              section we will discuss further the results of our testing.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h1 class="text-center">Unit Testing</h1>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
              <img src="img/kbane.png" class="img-fluid shadow-sm" />
              <img src="img/Untitled 2 (2).png" class="img-fluid shadow-sm" />
            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              Unit tests include workouts and insights, which represent the core
              for not only that part of functionality but overlap with any new
              addition we had in the app throughout its development. Making sure
              that foundations hold despite any modifications was crucial in
              keeping it safe and free of malfunctions. Furthermore, in order to
              provide isolated testing, we created an entirely new project on
              its own branch, where not only can we test the models separately
              from the interaction of the user, but provide a layer of
              independence, making sure that functionalities of the app are safe
              themselves, and therefore mitigate the functional errors which
              could eliminate the seamless and intuitive use cases that we were
              trying to build for our users. Going layer by layer in the
              foundational aspects of the app, we managed to build an app which
              will be modular, since the core of it will be separated
            </p>
          </div>
          <h1 class="text-center">Integration Testing</h1>
          <div class="row">

              <img
                src="img/savedinsightsandworkoutstests.png"

            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              Integration testing required us to identify what are the
              high-level functionalities we had for our users. We found that, at
              its core, the app needs testing for two specific points connected
              with insights and workouts, and those two points are quite
              intuitively, saved insights and saved workouts, respectively.
              Since we are saving the insights we had to mock adding of the
              workouts to the dedicated folder as well as extracting them from
              it, checking the correctness of their count in the process.
              Similar aspects applied to insights, although due to its inherent
              greater complexity, we had to add additional test cases, which
              would test its broader functionality with the regards to the
              high-level aspect of the app.

          <h1 class="text-center"><br />User Acceptance Testing</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            To check if our app met users’ expectations we met with four
            different people, all from different backgrounds, but with the
            common factor that they all are target users of our project, as they
            all suffer from a visual impairment.

            From these responses we notices some key areas to improve ahead of
            the final app release, mainly the accessibility of the GUI. We made
            buttons even bigger and further simplified the GUI. Another change
            we implemented was during an active workout, now if the heart rate
            values is too high, there will be a colour change in the label
            displaying the heart rate so the user can visually notice the
            warning sign.
            <br />
            <br />
            After we had made those changes, we let the users try our final
            release version and asked them their opinion on the same statements:

            <br />
            The main conclusion we can draw from their responses is that the app
            caters to and meets the needs of visually impaired people, which was
            our main objective. We can also discover from the responses than one
            minor improvement to be made is the addition of more training
            intents / types as to include everyone’s fitness lifestyle.
            <br /><br />
            The integration & unit testing showed that the foundational
            components that we were building upon are safe and secure with
            regards to any modifications we, therefore ensuring us that any bugs
            which appear in the development of its broader functionality
            originate exactly from that additonal code rather than the core
            components of our app. Allowing us to be focus and determined on
            creating the best accessibility-first fitness tracking app there is.

              We have reviewed current software products that offer similar
              services to the ones the “VeloCity” project aims to deliver. There
              are many fitness tracking apps on the market, but they do not seem
              to fit the needs of people with disabilities. They tend to be very
              visual, which is not suited for blind and visually impaired.
              Furthermore, health tracking in these apps is created around an
              average person, putting everyone else out of the equation. We are
              here to change that for the better, focusing on specific needs of
              everyone. Cherishing their abilities, but being aware of their
              disabilities, and creating the app surround them and not a
              fictional person. However, some companies are trying to change
              that with more or less success. Our goal is to gather insights
              from existing apps, both pros and cons. Finally, getting the right
              view of what has been done, what must be fixed, as well as what
              innovation we have to add, to make people’s dreams a reality.
              Making everyone feel included and important both as individuals,
              and as a collective as well.

              Although Zwift does not offer full range of fitness tracking
              services, it is the closest thing to what our goal would be.
              Giving seamless sports experience with big accent on its social
              aspects. Zwift is bringing people together and making them lead
              healthier lifestyles through cycling, which is amazing. The app
              has, many pros, but also some important cons, which need to be
              addressed and used in our use case:

            <br /><br /><b>Seamless Experience - User-Flow Led By Intuition</b>
          </h4>
          <p class="lead">
            The most important aspect in designing an accessibility-driven app
            was crafting something that is led by intuition rather than the set
            of mechanical instruction the user needs to follow. The approach was
            to not think like a developer, but like an every-day user, who would
            use this app extensively. We asked ourselves and others, what would
            be the most natural way to use a fitness tracker? That led us to the
            following feedback-oriented design and sequence diagrams, where each
            element of the user-flow was carefully chosen and implemented into a
            cohesive structure we have today.

            To briefly describe each component, we would need to differentiate 4
            main layers in the application: user, front-end, back-end and

                User: an actor which interacts with the app, records workouts,
                checks insights. Design of the app was oriented around the user
                which required moving the complexity further away and presenting
                the user with only what’s needed and useful.

                processes, uses XAML to compile UI elements and present them in
                the best way possible to the user. In order to help connecting
                these user elements with the rest of the app, use of C# Code
                Behind helped in bridging the gap, this time between front-end
                and back-end solutions.

                Storage: in order to save workouts and insights we had to
                implement a storage system for storing the relevant data for its
                repeated use. We opted for using CSV text files, and you can
                find more about this in our section Data Storage, on this

          <p class="lead">
            Since the app is developed in .NET MAUI framework, all processes,
            such as compiling XAML code containing layout and appearance
            information, into platform-specific UI elements are done in the
            background, allowing for only a single point of contact between the
            user and the app. Due to the complexity of the project, and
            considering the fact that the app was built from the ground up in
            this new framework, we will define more high-level aspects here,
            while going more into details within the Implementation tab on our

            <h4><br /><b>Data storage</b></h4>
            <h5><br /><b>Adaptability-Oriented Approach</b></h5>
            <p class="lead">
              To guarantee maintainability and simplify future upgrades, we
              decided to use highly efficient and straightforward form of
              persistent data storage, text files. More specifically, text files
              in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. Some of the benefits to
              this approach were the following:
            </p>

            <h6><br /><b>Adaptability</b></h6>
            <p class="lead">
              Text files in CSV format are compatible and hence supported by
              wide variety of platforms and programming languages, allowing for
              greater simplicity when shifting towards future technologies or
              demands.
            </p>

            <h6><br /><b>Readability</b></h6>
            <p class="lead">
              Files in this format are inherently much more readable than other
              storage alternatives, enabling future app developers to
              effortlessly perform modifications, upgrades, as well as resolve
              any issues that may arise in the process.
            </p>
            <h6><br /><b>Simple Parsing</b></h6>
            <p class="lead">
              Using CSV text files allows for quick data transformation, such as
              filtering, sorting and similar. The intrinsic simplicity of the
              parsing also means that we have much lower computational overhead
              unlike other storage systems. All of this leads to faster
              execution times of data-related tasks, as well as more optimised
              use of device resources, which fits great in our implementation.
            </p>
            <h5><br /><b>Data Schema Design</b></h5>
            <p class="lead">
              Following the aforementioned benefits of using CSV files, such as
              adaptability, readability and simple parsing, we agreed on keeping
              them valuable when designing our data schema, which we used for
              storing workouts and insights about finished exercises. Both
              workouts and insights are being stored in App Data Directory, with
              an extension of “.workout.txt” and “.insight.txt” respectively.

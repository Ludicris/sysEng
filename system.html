          <h4><br />Introduction</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Over the years, the mobile applications transformed the way we use
            technology in our daily lives. From solely enabling us to
            communicate through phone calls to supporting us in managing
            personal finances and tracking our health and fitness goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            This tremendous advancement of mobile applications was unfortunately
            not followed by comprehensive accessibility features, which would
            allow people with blindness to use them with ease.
            <br />
            <br />
            According to Washington University [1], almost every person who uses
            an assistive technology, such as a screen reader, can describe
            negative experiences with apps that do not provide proper support.
            <br />
            <br />
            All of this made our team even more motivated to create something
            meaningful, something inclusive, something that will be equally
            useful to disabled and non-disabled.
            <br />
            <br />
            “We were determined to make the accessibility-first fitness tracking
            app.”
            <br />
            <br />
            The most important aspect of developing such an app was without a
            doubt the User Interface Design, since it acts as the crucial link
            bridging the gap between individuals with disabilities and those
            without.
          </p>

          <h4><br />Accessibility-First Design Principles</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Throughout this page, we will go over all of the most important
            aspects of the User Interface Design, which is what really makes
            this app unlike many others in the fitness tracking app market.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>High Contrast Colours</b>
            <br />
            When designing the app, we opted for using
            <b>high contrast colours.</b>
            Not only do they provide better accessibility for visually impaired
            users, but also accommodate the needs of those with colour
            blindness.

            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Intuitive and Simple Navigation</b>
            <br />
            To make sure that our app is as simple to use as possible, we moved
            away from using pop-up windows and convoluted multi-layered
            navigation tree with vast number of different options to using
            <b>intuitive and simple</b> streamlined system which allows users to
            know where they are and what they are doing at every point in time.
            <br />

          <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Screen Reader Friendliness</b>
            <br />
            Although many apps are compatible with screen readers such as
            TalkBack, many of them have not yet managed to thoroughly implement
            all of its functionalities, incorporating it with the app’s design
            itself.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <img src="img/bane_3.png" />
          <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Disability-Inclusive Design Elements</b>
            <br />
            Although screen readers help individuals with blindness, relying
            solely on them, they tend to exclude visually impaired people who
            prefer not to use them. How we approached this challenge was
            designing the core aspects of the UI with respect to their needs.
            That comprised of using increased text visibility, large simple
            controls, and implementing advanced features during active workout
            such as colour brightness change respective to the range set, as
            well as the use of shapes to also assist users with colour vision
            deficiencies [2].

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">

            <br />
            <br />
          </figure>

          <figure class="figure">

          <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Speech Recognition - Virtual Coach Integration</b>
            <br />
            This is what primarily differs our app from all the others. Adding
            this functionality didn’t only enhance the user experience, but
            opened up an entirely new layer of interaction with the device and
            the app itself. From being able to check your heart rate during the
            workout to getting motivation when needed, all without a touch of a
            button. This represents a universal point of access for all types of
            app users, ranging from those with disabilities to those without.

          <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Text-To-Speech Feature</b>
            <br />
            Apart from screen reader functionality, it offers built in
            text-to-speech integration, which ends up being helpful not only to
            those using screen readers every day, but also visually impaired
            people who just need some extra help when reading the text on the
            screen. Although it enables features like single switch button for
            selecting different types of activity types and training intents, it
            also allows for virtual coach features mentioned in the Speech
            Recognition Integration section.

            <br />
            The development story starts here, after numerous iterations and
            continuous feedback from the potential users, we ended up using the
            following final design, transferring it from the paper to lines of
            code in the process.
